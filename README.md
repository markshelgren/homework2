Bootcamp Homework 2

This repository contains the solution for Bootcamp Homework assignment number 2.

The solution was created by Mark Shelgren to meet the requirements of homework assignment number 2.

In summary the assignment is to develope a 3 page "application" based on biographical information and life experience of the author.

The pages themselves are relatively simple in nature. One with a form to generate an email. The challenge is to make all of the pages and navigation "responsive" to the device being used on.
